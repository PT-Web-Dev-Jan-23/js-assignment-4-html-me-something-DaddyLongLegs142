               <pre>
                  "Oh freddled gruntbuggly,
                  thy micturations are to me
                  as plurdled gaggleblotchits
                  on a lurgid bee
                  groop I implore thee
                  my foonting turlingdromes
                  and hooptiously drangle me
                  with crinkly bindlewurdles
                  or I will rend thee in the gabberworts
                  with my blurglecruncheon
                  see if I don't!"

               “The major problem—one of the major problems, for there are several—one of the many major problems with governing people is that of whom you get to do it; or rather of who manages to get people to let them do it to them.
To summarize: it is a well-known fact that those people who must want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it.
To summarize the summary: anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job.”
